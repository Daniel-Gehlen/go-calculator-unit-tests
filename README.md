**Calculator Challenge Report**

**Objective:**

The goal was to implement a basic calculator with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and to write unit tests to ensure correct functionality.

**Development:**

**Calculator Implementation (calculator.go)**

- Created a package `calculator` with functions `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, and `Divide`.
- Each function takes two float64 numbers as input and returns the result of the operation.
- The `Divide` function checks if the divisor is zero and returns an error if positive.

**Unit Tests (calculator_test.go)**

- Created a package `calculator_test` to store unit tests.
- Each test function verifies the behavior of one of the calculator functions.
- The tests check if the functions return the correct values and identify errors.
- One specific test checks the case of division by zero.

**Test Execution**

- Used the `go test` command to execute the unit tests.
- Test execution verifies if the calculator code is functioning as expected.

**Additional Improvements:**

- Boundary Cases Tests: Add tests for other boundary cases, such as negative numbers, large values, etc.
- Testing Tools: Utilize testing tools like GoConvey or Ginkgo to write more expressive and readable tests.
- Integration of Tests: Integrate tests into the development process to ensure the code is always functioning as expected.
